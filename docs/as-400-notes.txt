What is an AS/400?
•IBM’s “Application System”/400
•Multi-user, multi-tasking

“System”
•The AS/400 is the “system”
– “The system is down” 
– “The system is slow today”

OS400
• AS/400 Operating System
• Object-Based
• Not only does it control all the activity onthe AS/400, but it also incorporates manyfeatures that would be separate softwarecomponents on other systems.

Licensed Programs
•Programming Languages
 – Pascal, PL/1, Basic, RPG, C, C++, Cobol, Java,SQL, etc.

System Values
•Control and Configuration attributes thatallow you to customize the operatingenvironment to suit the company.
•These values define what the default valueswill be.
•You can’t change them, but you can look atthem.

“User”
•A person who “uses” the AS/400
•A User will have unique Userid
•A Userid identifies you to the system whenyou signon
•Each Userid has a User Profile which describes the user and their authorities

“Subsystem”
• Jobs run in subsystems.
•An operating environment in which systemresources (eg. main storage) are divided upand allocated.
•Enable better performance tuning.•Described in subsystem descriptions.
•Most are started at IPL time.

“Job”
•A “job” is any and every piece of work onthe AS/400.
•There are two types of jobs:
– Interactive jobs 
– Batch jobs

“Interactive Jobs”
•A job that begins when a user signs on to the system and ends when they sign off.
•It is a  job with interaction between the user and the AS/400, similar to aconversation ( a polite conversation!).
•Input for the job is entered via the screen.


“Batch Jobs”
•A job that runs in the background. 
•They do not require input from the screen, but would read data from files.
•They are generally jobs that use a lot of resources and are lower priority than interactive jobs.
•Usually submitted by interactive jobs e.g.a program compile


“Subsystem”
• Jobs run in subsystems.
•An operating environment in which system resources (eg. main storage) are divided up and allocated.
•Enable better performance tuning.
•Described in subsystem descriptions.
•Most are started at IPL time.

Two subsystems
• Interactive jobs run in subsystem QINTER
• Batch jobs run in subsystem QBATCH 

Queues
•A queue is a line-up! A place where things wait.
•Examples of AS/400 queues:
–  job queues: where batch jobs wait 
– message queues: where messages wait 
– output queues: where spool files wait to print

The AS/400 is easy to use
•Menu driven
•Lots of built-in help
•Built-in security

The Signon Screen
•The first level of security, it keeps out unauthorized people
•It requires a valid userid and password (see your sticky label)
•Always remember to signoff if you aregoing to leave your computer. If you don’t,someone could come along and clobber your work!

The AS/400 is “Green Screen”
•Green screen v.s. GUI (Graphical User Interface
•You can’t point and click!
•You must use the TAB keys to go from field to field

IBM AS/400 Help
• F1 = HELP
• Field Level
• Extended Help
• Info Seeker 

A. Files

Files = objects that store data
ie. customer file: customer #, address, billing info etc.
for each customer 
source file - special file that stores a programmer’s’source code
eg. Judy stores all her source code in source file Judysrc (in library Judylib)

File Member 
Source files have many ‘members’ one member for each source program
eg. Judysrc file has 3 members: RPGPGM1,RPGPGM2, CLPROG, each contains a different program
PDM (Prog Dev Mgr) give easy access to a programmer’s stuff (libs/files/mbrs)


B. Database Files

Types of *FILES
Physical File PF
Source
Data
Logical File LF
Printer File PRTF
Display File DSPF

Source Physical File vsData Physical File
•Source Physical File
 –Layout is fixed: 3 fields
	•programmers can only alter the length of the textfield
 –Used to store code
•Data Physical File
 –Layout is determined by Application Design
 –Used to store data

What are the steps used to createa Physical Data File?
•Create a Source Physical File called QDDSSRC
•Create a source member in QDDSSRC withthe name of the Data Physical File
•Type in the DDS Code
•Save the Code
•Compile the Code


Once a physical file has been created,how can data be loaded into it?
DFU
SQL
Copy File
Write a program

List all of the steps required to create a program described file and to put datainto it.
- Use the CRTPF command to create the file with a specific record length
- Use a ‘Copy’ command to copy data into the file, or SQL, or write a program, or DFU.

List all of the steps required to create anexternally described file and to put datainto it.
- Create the source physical file member 
- Type in the DDS code
- Use the CRTPF command to create the file with the record layout specified in the DDS Code
- Use a ‘Copy’ command to copy data into the file, or SQL, or write a program, or DFU.

AS/400 Architecture
- Software Applications do not have to be changed or recompiled with the operating system changes.
- Model Names denote the age and speed of the processor.
- Old style: B, C, D, E, F
- New style:720, 740, etc.
- Software vendors base licensing fees on Model

Object?
- takes up space on the AS400 
- Has a Description
- Has an Object Type
- ... are ‘stored in’ (addressed by) libraries

Object Types
Certain types of commands only work withcertain types of Object Typeseg. DSPUSRPRF
Object Type is assigned to the Object at time of creation eg. CRTLIB creates objects with a type of *LIB

How the AS/400 finds Objects
- When an object is created, it is created ‘in’ a particular library.
- To access an object, the AS/400 needs to know whatlibrary the object is in.
- The library is really a directory which contains pointers to the objects in that library.


AS/400 commands ask for library and object names
(CL) Commands prompt you for the object name and library name
.eg. CALL and press F4: prompts you for program tocall (the object we are accessing in this case) and the library in which that program object resides. 
We could have a program object named PROGA in two different libraries!

Library Lists
- What if we are always accessing objects in thesame libraries over and over again?
- We have to tell the system again and again inwhich library to find the object? PAIN!
- Hence, the library list. When I go to use anobject, assume it is in a library in my library list,a list of commonly used libraries.


LIBL vs Qualified Object Name 
- the default for the library parameter incommands is *LIBL - Search my Library List for the object
- Library List is a convenience only, you can always access a library not on the list! (as longas your user profile has proper authority to thelibrary) 
- Qualified Object Name:
    Library/Object  ie. CMOPS324/REVIEWS


A few special objects
Note: Library Descriptions, Device Descriptions and User Profiles are stored in library QSYS.
This means that you do not have to specify a library name when you access these objects.

Spooled Files
- When you print something, a spool file is created withthe data to be printed
- WRKSPLF shows your spooled files
- Are stored in Output Queues
- To print a Spooled File, the file must be moved to anOutput Queue attached to a printer.


How Do Spooled Files get Created?
QINTER

1. Job 
Program/Command (Data *FILE, Report Layout *FILE) = Spooled file

2. Output Queue
	Spooled File


"Work with Jobs" Command
- To display information about your current Interactive job, simply type: WRKJOB
- To display information about any other job, usethe Work With Job and enter the Job Name andUser. Number is Optional.
- To display your Batch Jobs, use the Work with Submitted Jobs Commands (WRKSBMJOB)

WRKUSRJOB (command)
Shows you a list of all of the jobs that you own on thesystem irregardless of the subsystem
Status
	Active = Job is currently running
	Outq = Job is finished
	Jobq = Job is waiting to process.
Do delete a ‘run-away’ job, take option 4


WRKSPLF vs WRKOUTQ
- WRKSPLF groups all of YOUR spooled files together onone screen irregardless of the Output Queue
- WRKOUTQ groups together all of the spooled file in ONE output queue irregardless of the USER

WRKSPLF option 2. Change the Spooled File to OutQ (PRT01)
WRKSPLF-2(DC234X99(SPLF#1, SPLF#2))=PRT01(SPLF#3, SPLF#4)

Lab 1 Objectives
•Get you familiar with AS/400 greenscreens, using menus etc.
•Review some of the definitions covered inlecture (user profile, jobs, subsystem, screentypes, accessing help)
•Set up your stuff for later labs (a file for youto store your programs)

“Objects”
•any thing on the AS/400 that has a nameand takes up space in storage
•on Unix/Windows, everything is a file
•on AS/400, everything is an object
•on Windows, files have extensions (.txt)
•on AS/400 objects have types
•Common object types include:
 – libraries, files, job queues, programs

“Libraries”
• Library: an object whose purpose is to‘store’ and index other objects. ie. objectsare ‘stored’ in libraries.
•Exactly like a directory in Unix/Windowshowever you do not have libraries withinlibraries on the AS/400.
•Example: user Deb stores all her objects in library DEBLIB

Library Lists
Each job has an attached Library List
Different Types of Libraries:
- System: IBM Supplied
- Product:Added automatically when an IBM product is used
- Current: Defined by an individual user ID
User ID’s default Library
- User: Non-IBM Supplied Libraries
Created by Business to organize programs, files,etc.

Library List - Determine where a Job finds Objects

Parts of a Library List (or the 4 library list types)
- System (SYS)
- Product (PRD)
- Current (CUR)
- User (USR)


Library List Commands
ADDLIBLE - Adds an entry to a library list to the USER portion of the library list
RMVLIBLE - Removes an entry from the USER portion of thelibrary list
EDTLIBL - Adds/Deletes/Changes entries on the USER portionof the library list
CHGCURLIB - Changes the Current Library
CHGLIBL - Changes the Current Library and allowsAdd/Change/Delete to the USER portion of thelibrary list.
*** All Library List commands are listed on the CMDLIBL menu.
*** Don’t rename or delete your current Library!

Questions
How do I know what the *&(&!! Commands are?
How do I know what the !@#!@ Keywords are?
 

Naming of Commands
- Based on English!
- Combination of Verb and Noun
e.g. CRTLIB = Create + Library
 

Naming of Commands cont’d
Typically start with the following verbs:
CL Verb	English		Description
..........................................................
CALL	Call		Executes a program
GO	Go to		Executes a Menu
CPY	Copy		Copies a file
CRT	Create		Creates an object
DSP	Display		Displays something about anobject
WRK	Works With	Works with an object

How do I find the Keywords to a command?Type the command and press F4



 
 
What does the ‘*’ denote?

 
 
‘*’ (Asterix)
When used before an ‘AS/400’ word, indicatesthat the word is a special value.eg. CRTLIB LIB(MOOGK1)TYPE(*TEST) TEXT(‘Cindys Library)When used at the end of a word, indicates ageneric combination of alphanumerics(wildcards).eg. WRKLIB SIMON*

 
 
Use of the ‘?’Entering a command to see all possible values for aparameter.F4 does the same
